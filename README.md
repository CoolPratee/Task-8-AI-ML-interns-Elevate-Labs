# K-Means Clustering - Mall Customer Segmentation

## 📌 Objective
To perform customer segmentation using K-Means clustering (unsupervised learning).

## 📊 Dataset
Mall Customers dataset containing customer demographics and spending behavior.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## 🚀 Steps Performed
1. Loaded and explored dataset
2. Selected relevant features (Annual Income, Spending Score)
3. Applied feature scaling
4. Used Elbow Method to determine optimal clusters
5. Applied K-Means clustering
6. Visualized clusters and centroids
7. Evaluated model using Silhouette Score

## 📈 Results
- Optimal number of clusters: 5
- Silhouette Score: ~0.5 (approx)

## 📚 Learnings
- Unsupervised learning
- K-Means clustering algorithm
- Elbow Method
- Cluster evaluation techniques

## 📎 Conclusion
K-Means effectively segments customers into distinct groups based on spending behavior.
